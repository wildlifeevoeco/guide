# Projects

## Project structure

Some example structures:

```         
project
└───data/
    └───derived/
    └───raw/
└───R/
└───script/
└───graphics/
└───README.md
```

or

```         
project/
└───README.md
└───input/
└───output/
└───R/
└───graphics/
```

Directories briefly explained:

-   `data/` holds `derived-data` and `raw-data`
-   `R/` holds functions (reusuable chunks of code used throughout
    project)
-   `scripts/` holds scripts (series of analysis steps usually including
    reading input and writing output/figures)
-   `graphics/` or `figures/` holds output figures and plots
-   `manuscript/` or `paper/` for storing the manuscript
-   `man/` holds the documentation of your functions, usually
    automatically generated with
    [{roxygen2}](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/)

We'll use the [SocCaribou](https://github.com/wildlifeevoeco/SocCaribou)
project as an example throughout the following sections.

### README

A `README.md` file should always be included and stores plenty of
information about the project. For example:

-   installation instructions
-   TODOs
-   description or purpose of the project
-   authors
-   news
-   known bugs or limitations
-   instructions for contributing
-   links to license, Zenodo, etc.

READMEs can change throughout the course of a project's lifecycle.
Through the development of a project, it might have more TODOs, notes
about project and be generally messier. As the project becomes more
stable or mature, is meant to be more public-facing, or to accompany a
publication, it should be organized more as a landing page for new
users/readers.

For example, the SocCaribou README:

``` md

## Space-use and social organization in a gregarious ungulate: testing the conspecific attraction and resource dispersion

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper “Space-use and
social organization in a gregarious ungulate: testing the conspecific
attraction and resource dispersion”. Scripts are under `scripts/` and
reused functions are in `R/`. This project uses standard R package
structure and can therefore be installed with `devtools`. This also
helps declare external package dependencies required for the analysis.
Please note that while functions are included here, they are not tested
for use in other projects and may not be suitable (at least not in their
current version).

## Abstract
Animals use a variety of proximate cues to assess habitat quality when resources
vary spatiotemporally. Two non-mutually exclusive strategies to assess habitat
quality involve either direct assessment of landscape features or observation of
social cues from conspecifics as a form of information transfer about forage
resources. [...]

### RStudio projects

Working in RStudio Projects helps us avoid `setwd()` hell. If you share
an RStudio Project (`.RProj`) with someone else, they can immediately
use it without changing working directories or paths to files.

### Workflows

[This section](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/functions.html) of the
{targets} manual has a great overview of two approaches to managing
interconnected analysis steps and data:

1.  script-based workflows
2.  function-oriented workflows

#### Function-oriented workflows

Read the link above, then see the [section on
{targets}](https://weel.gitlab.io/guide/targets.html).

#### Script-based workflows

R scripts can be organized into `scripts/` and `R/`. The `scripts/`
folder holds analysis scripts, often (ideally) numbered in the order
they should be run in. For example, in the SocCaribou project there's
`1-Data-Cleaning.R` then `2-HomeRangeAnalysis.R`. See Jenny Bryan's
[project oriented workflow](https://rstats.wtf/projects). The `R/`
folder is used for functions. Functions help us chunk out larger project
into manageable pieces of code.

It doesn't have to be one or the other - if you have a discrete chunk of
code that needs to be applied multiple times, or might be useful in
another project, etc, just write it as a function and drop it into your
`R/` folder. In addition, the `R/` folder is recognized if you turn your
project into a package or a research compendium as the standard place
and structure for functions.

See the [SocCaribou](https://github.com/wildlifeevoeco/SocCaribou)
project that has both an `R/` folder and a `scripts/` folder.

```

│   ├── 5-Randomizations.R

```

### Data

Always start with raw data. Keep raw data raw in a `raw-data/` or
`input/` folder.

Then use scripts to prepare and organize your data - never modify it by
hand. This way, you can go always go back to the raw data in case
anything changes in your preparation steps.

Output data can be sorted into `output/` folders and saved as an `.Rds`
files using the base R functions: `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()`. More
details in [Efficient R / Binary file
formats](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/input-output.html#binary-file-formats).
Or if you use `data.table`, use `fread` and `fwrite` to read/write CSV
files. If your dates are stored in the ISO standard format, they will be
automatically converted to `IDate` by `fread`.

### Metadata

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-WIP-yellow.svg)

Keep track of where the raw data comes from, how it was generated, by
who, when, etc using metadata. See the
[`metadata`](https://gitlab.com/weel/metadata) project and the metadata
{targets} workflow. Use this project to write metadata for your data.
Talk to Alec about using it and contributing your own metadata to it!

### License

For help choosing an open source license for code, see
<https://choosealicense.com/>

![](images/choose-a-license.png)

Note, you can change an open source license for an existing project but
typically you need to ask permission from everyone else that has
contributed. (Not legal advice) but more
[here](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/33/how-can-a-project-be-relicensed)
and
[here](https://copyright.universityofcalifornia.edu/ownership/joint-works.html)
to start.

For data, different license types apply. See
<https://choosealicense.com/non-software/>.

If you are publishing both code and data, include both licenses
alongside the relevant objects. For example:

```         
Project
| LICENSE.md (eg. GPL-3)
├── R
│   ├── dynamic_network.R
│   ├── hr_network.R
│   └── step_length.R
├── data
│   ├── LICENSE.md (eg. CC0)
│   ├── movement.csv
│   ├── habitat.csv
│   └── insect.csv
...
```

### News

Keeping track of changes in plain English can be helpful for your
current and future self, as well as collaborators. Try to use dates,
describe your progress and reasoning, and link to any issues or pull
requests.

Some recommendations and advice:

-   for R packages: <https://r-pkgs.org/other-markdown.html#sec-news>
-   Keep a changelog: <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/>
