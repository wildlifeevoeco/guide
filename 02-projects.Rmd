# Projects

## Project structure

Some example structures: 

```
project
└───data/
    └───derived/
    └───raw/
└───R/
└───script/
└───graphics/
└───README.md
```

or

```
project/
└───README.md
└───input/
└───output/
└───R/
└───graphics/
```

We'll use the [SocCaribou](https://github.com/wildlifeevoeco/SocCaribou) project as an example throughout the following sections. 

### README

A `README.md` file should always be included and stores plenty of information about the project. Installation instructions, TODOs, description or purpose of the project, authors, news, known bugs or limitations, instructions for contributing, link to license, etc. 

For example, the SocCaribou README:

```md

## Space-use and social organization in a gregarious ungulate: testing the conspecific attraction and resource dispersion

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper “Space-use and
social organization in a gregarious ungulate: testing the conspecific
attraction and resource dispersion”. Scripts are under `scripts/` and
reused functions are in `R/`. This project uses standard R package
structure and can therefore be installed with `devtools`. This also
helps declare external package dependencies required for the analysis.
Please note that while functions are included here, they are not tested
for use in other projects and may not be suitable (at least not in their
current version).

### Scripts
R scripts can be organized into `scripts/` or `R/`. The `R/` folder is used by R packages to store functions and this can be a useful way of differentiating different kinds of R scripts. 

The [SocCaribou](https://github.com/wildlifeevoeco/SocCaribou) project has both an `R/` folder and a `scripts/` folder. 

```

### Data

Data can be sorted into `input/` and `output/` folers. 
Alternatively, data can be divided according to `raw-data/` and `derived-data/`.

### Etc 
Other elements include:

* LICENSE file -  [Choose an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/)
* `graphics/` or `figures/` folder for figures and plots
* `manuscript/` or `paper/` folder for storing the manuscript
* `man/` folder for storing the documentation of your functions
* [Keep a ChangeLog / News file](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Traditionally in the R community, it is stored in a `NEWS.md` file. 

## RStudio projects
Always work within RStudio Projects to avoid `setwd()` hell. If you share an RStudio Project (`.RProj`) with someone else, they can immediately use it without changing working directories or paths to files. 

Details: [Efficient R / Project Management](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#project-management). 


### Data
Always start with raw data. Use scripts to prepare and organize your data - never modify it by hand. This way, you can go always go back to the raw data in case anything changes in your prep steps. Keep track of where the raw data comes from, how it was generated, by who, when, etc. 

#### Intermediate outputs
Save intermediate outputs to `.Rds` files using the base R functions: `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()`. Again, more details in [Efficient R / Binary file formats](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/input-output.html#binary-file-formats)
