# Projects

## Project structure

Some example structures: 

```
project
└───data/
    └───derived/
    └───raw/
└───R/
└───script/
└───graphics/
└───README.md
```

or

```
project/
└───README.md
└───input/
└───output/
└───R/
└───graphics/
```

We'll use the [SocCaribou](https://github.com/wildlifeevoeco/SocCaribou) project as an example throughout the following sections. 

### README

A `README.md` file should always be included and stores information about the project. Installation instructions, TODOs, description or purpose of the project, authors, etc. 

```md

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper “Space-use and
social organization in a gregarious ungulate: testing the conspecific
attraction and resource dispersion”. Scripts are under `scripts/` and
reused functions are in `R/`. This project uses standard R package
structure and can therefore be installed with `devtools`. This also
helps declare external package dependencies required for the analysis.
Please note that while functions are included here, they are not tested
for use in other projects and may not be suitable (at least not in their
current version).

## Abstract
...
```


### Scripts
R scripts can be organized into `scripts/` or `R/`. The `R/` folder is used by R packages to store functions and this can be a useful way of differentiating different kinds of R scripts. 

The [SocCaribou](https://github.com/wildlifeevoeco/SocCaribou) project has both an `R/` folder and a `scripts/` folder.

### Data

Data can be sorted into `input/` and `output/` folers. 
Alternatively, data can be divided according to `raw-data/` and `derived-data/`.

### Etc 
Other elements can include:

* LICENSE file -  [Choose an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/)
* `graphics/` or `figures/` folder for figures and plots
* `manuscript/` or `paper/` folder for storing the manuscript
* `man/` folder for storing the documentation of your functions


## RStudio projects
https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#project-management


saveRDS and readRDS between intermediate scripts
https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/input-output.html#binary-file-formats


always start with raw data

keep raw data raw, never modify it by hand

keep track of where data comes from, how it was generated, when it was generated
