This guide is for students and friends of the Wildlife Evolutionary
Ecology Lab. At the moment, it walks through some of the steps from
setting up your computer, to analysis and visualization, to writing and
sharing your outcomes with others. Some parts of the guide present the
authors’ opinions - but there’s always a number of ways to do something.
Use whatever works best for you. This is a living resource, so please
contribute anything you feel would be useful to others.
