## Issues

Issues are a tool available on GitLab and GitHub for collaborating on projects, getting help and tracking decisions. They are used extensively in the FOSS world and are often the way `R` package developers opt to receive bug reports and feature requests from their users.

Issues can be used for both **personal** and **group** projects.

Some uses include:

* collaborating
* developing methods
* troubleshooting code
* tracking decisions or assumptions
* defining thresholds, variables
* reporting bugs
* requesting new features

Issues have a number of advantages over private email, in-person conversations and TODO, NOTE and other comments embedded in code.

Issues:

* track history
* are easily searched
* can be grouped or categorized using labels
* can be assigned to individuals, groups or teams
* keep everyone in the loop
* are a resource for future users (including yourself!)

### Example issues
#### Bug or troubleshooting
> I'm trying to do this and it isn't working. 

```{md}
# Some concise title
(One/two sentence description summarizing issue. )

## Steps to reproduce
(How one can reproduce the issue)
1.
2.
3.

## Observed behaviour

## Expected behaviour

## Sample of output tables, screenshots

## Possible fixes

## Session info
(if R related, paste the results of sessionInfo())
```

#### Method development
> I'd like to try and do this

```{md}
# Some concise title
(One/two sentence description summarizing the objective. )

## Description
(Include goals, use cases, benefits)

## Progress
(Where did you get?)

## Next steps
(How do you think we could solve it? Who can you assign
  this issue to? Who can you mention to get their input?)

```

**And once solved, post the code that actually solved it**. This is one of the main ways that Issues can be useful to future users.
